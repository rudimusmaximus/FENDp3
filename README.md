# How to load and play the game
Just load a game and play with keyboard arrows, so you need a web browser and a keyboard.

## To Load A Game
Simply load the index.html file by clicking here `//TODO: hosted github pages link when ready`

## To Play A Game
"In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

 - The player can move left, right, up and down
 - The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
 - Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
 - Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won
Check out a quick video demo of the game in action below!"

===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

# My Notes Completing This

## Lessons learned:  

| Area | Comments |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. Issues | a. GitHub disables issues for forked repositories. b. Options are to use an out of sync GitKraken Glow board or c. use pseudo code and `//TODO:` markers to track changes and notes rather than issues d. I will build the rest of the projects from scratch so i can use my usual approach with config and issue templates which are included here. Because I want to keep these for notes and use issues over time, I deleted by p3 fork and started from downloaded files. P2 will be the only submission of mine to use forked repo to start. P3 - end will create standalone repos. |
| 2. topic | a. notes TODO: update |
| 3. topic | a. notes TODO: update |
| 4. topic | a. notes TODO: update |

## Assumptions required to solve the problem
The following assumptions were made by evaluation the code and all given instructions:
 - most of our solution can be done in app.js

 - ES6 is ok to use without transpiling with Babel

 - TODO: more?

## Work Flow
I followed git commit guidelines, a 'Git Flow' branching model committing into develop until ready to test hosting and GitHub hosting. The repo is a fork hosted on GitHub. I used Atom and GitKraken with a Chrome browser for testing.

My focus is to catch up in the course, so I'm going to try to stick only to the requirements.

Now to finish in time! Thanks for reading this.

See develop for commit history with git commit style followed. Releases made to master and develop with tags on master following [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

## Resources used to complete this work
I read [Mathew Cranford's Arcade Game Walkthrough](https://matthewcranford.com/arcade-game-walkthrough-part-1-starter-code-breakdown/) series parts 1 - 6 whenever I got stuck.
I used this article as starting point to make my own [Modal in Pure ES6](https://lowrey.me/modals-in-pure-es6-javascript/).
I added a resource image from the web 'winner.gif', so my modal would load faster see issue # 1 comments for link.
